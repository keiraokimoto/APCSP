[College Board Big Idea 1](https://apclassroom.collegeboard.org/103/home?unit=1)

## Program Purpose and Development (Unit 1.3)
> Become familiar with Pseudo Code and style of questions.
- Lightly Review Videos and take notes on topics with Blog
- Complete assigned MCQ questions

### Project Ideas
> Look for a real need, Teacher/Student need, Educational Study or Simulation, Campus Club, Campus Interest, Business Interest, Charitable Organization, etc.  Of course, the greatest interest is <mark>Student Interest</mark>.  It does not work if only one student is interested.
- Starting Objective is to begin a code base.  Part of the vision is to  build skills for AP and Teacher requirements.  
- Be sure to pick something that you don't burn out on after a couple of weeks.  If you are a couple days into something and it is not working it is best to change. 
- IMO, it is much more interesting to work on something that has 3rd party interest and that you can ultimately acquire a 3rd party interest.  Working to acquire accolades is a big motivator.

> PBL. Concept/Idea in CSP Education.  This could be achieved using Blogging and Jupyter.  Some have said, it is possible to pass the AP exam in 1 month of study.  This would be 30 lessons / 1 hour lessons.
- Highlight all 10 Units from CB.
- Remake CB site to be Student Interest/Friendly, More Code, and less Video.
- The Web Site covers key topics from CB, also includes short coding exercises in Python or JavaScript (ie Mini-labs). Thus, everything  should be interactive.  The code and visuals should teach more than the words.
- Unit #1, #4, #5 would be a different style and these units are not directly on coding.  A lot of Human and Social materials.

## Hacks
> Now is time to transition from Purpose to Design and Development.Designs are required and must meet Teacher Approval.  These need to be put together in a Blog. 
- Brain Write. The process of just elaborating on ideas and sharing them with your team.
- Wire Frame, Concept.  Before coding start to outline what the project will look like.
- Modeling or UML.  Behavior, Interaction, Data diagrams

> Additionally, some development of Concepts can occur.  This should be focused on frontend or backend concepts.
- Frontend.  Wire Frame development is better than coding, at early stages.  But if you have clear idea and can articulate it in HTML or CSS it is OK to work there as well.
- Backend. Jupyter notebooks is a great way to thing about data and outputs.  Often a console program can help you imagine data as well as interaction.
